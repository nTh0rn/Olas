# Olas
Olas is a programming language made in the windows language Batch. It was started in February 2017. Olas is a very very simple programming language as it only allows 1 parameter-per-function.

Olas is not intended to actually be a good choice as a programming language. It exists only as an experiment I made early in Highschool.
